# Live-Chat-Web-Page
A simple messaging webpage

## Overview

This is a simple chat server based off the source code found in this IBM aricle(https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/x-ajaxxml8/index.html?ca=drs-). I made some surface level changes to the basic version of the code and added some more features.

## Why I made this

I made this to improve my understanding of AJAX, php and configuring of web servers.
